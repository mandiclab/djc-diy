1. 3D print the case.


2. Solder: (In meanwhile you can print other parts) (you can glue parts to case)

!!! How to wire Play/Cue Buttons on Deck 1 !!!

5V [VCC] ----- 10k [Resistor] ----- [D4/A6] [4] [Arduino Pin]
                                |
                                | ----- [Play Push Button] ----- 1k [Resistor] ----- [GND]
                                |
                                | ----- [Cue Push Button] ----- 330 [Resistor] ----- [GND]

3. Upload code to the Arduino

4. Put Mixxx mapping files in: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Mixxx\controllers

5. Test controller 

6. Assembly rest, put front panel first.

69. Enjoy :D
